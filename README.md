## 📝 Summary

A proactive IoT-AI emergency alert system for high-density tourist zones. Features physical panic buttons, AI-driven false alarm verification, and proximity-based notifications to authorities and civilians—ensuring faster, smarter, real-time public safety responses.

---

## 🚩 Project Overview

**IoT-AI Public Safety** is an open-source solution designed to revolutionize public safety in tourist hotspots and crowded public spaces. By combining accessible IoT hardware with intelligent, cloud-powered verification and location-aware communication, we empower both citizens and authorities with instant, actionable, and reliable emergency alerts.

---

## 🏆 Key Features

- 🛠️ **Physical Panic Buttons:** Fast, language-free reporting at the point of incident.
- 🤖 **AI-driven Verification:** Filters false alarms for more effective emergency response.
- 📍 **Proximity-Aware Notification:** Dynamic, geo-fenced SMS/call alerts to authorities and civilians.
- 🌐 **Cloud Backend:** Real-time alert data ingestion, status tracking, and smart dispatch.
- 📊 **Live Dashboard:** Web-based UI for visualization and management of incidents.
- 🔒 **Extensible & Secure:** Modular, scalable code and hardware for easy adaptation.

## 💡 Why IoT-AI Public Safety?

Current emergency solutions in tourist areas are often slow, fragmented, and difficult to access in panic situations. Our project puts a reliable, community-powered, and instantly verifiable alert system right where it’s needed most, leveraging the latest in IoT and AI for real, measurable impact.
